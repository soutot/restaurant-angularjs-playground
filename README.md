# restaurant-angularjs-playground

This ugly project is just a playground with some technologies and standards such as AngularJS, Yeoman, SVG, Gulp, SASS, BEM.

Here I created an example using SVG + AngularJS to make a seat reservation, applying some CSS on SVG:
app/#/take-your-seat

Here is just a filtering using AngularJS:
/app/#/dishes

And here, just a (bad :) ) form using AngularJS:
/app/#/contact-us

This is my first play with AngularJS. I expect to also build a database to register the form and the seat reservation, using MongoDB.
Besides of that, I would like to also create an ADM to handle the seats reservation (check whether clients already left the restaurant, for example)
